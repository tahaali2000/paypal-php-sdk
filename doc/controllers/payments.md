# Authorizations Reauthorize

Reauthorizes an authorized PayPal account payment, by ID. To ensure that funds are still available, reauthorize a payment after its initial three-day honor period expires. Within the 29-day authorization period, you can issue multiple re-authorizations after the honor period expires.<br/><br/>If 30 days have transpired since the date of the original authorization, you must create an authorized payment instead of reauthorizing the original authorized payment.<br/><br/>A reauthorized payment itself has a new honor period of three days.<br/><br/>You can reauthorize an authorized payment from 4 to 29 days after the 3-day honor period. The allowed amount depends on context and geography, for example in US it is up to 115% of the original authorized amount, not to exceed an increase of $75 USD.<br/><br/>Supports only the `amount` request parameter.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This request is currently not supported for Partner use cases.</blockquote>
